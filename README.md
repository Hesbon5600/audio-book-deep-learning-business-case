Deep Learning - Business Case example
***
###### Here's the problem.

You were given data from an audiobook app. Logically it relates to the audio version of books only each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once. That's the condition to be included.
We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the audio book company.
The main idea is that the company shouldn't spend its advertising budget targeting individuals who are unlikely to come back.
If we can focus our efforts on customers likely to convert again we can obtain improved sales and profitability figures.
So our model will take several metrics and we'll try to predict human behavior a side effect of our study is that the model will show us which are the most important metrics for a customer to come back.
Having the data and the technology to identify prospective customers creates a lot of value and growth opportunities.
It is one of the better applications of data science.
